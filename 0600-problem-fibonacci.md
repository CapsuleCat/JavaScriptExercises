The fibonacci sequence is determined by taken in the previous two numbers in the sequence and adding them together. The first number is 1, and the second number is 2 by definition. The third number in the sequence is 2 by adding the first two numbers in the sequence.

Remember that your recursive function has to terminaters  somewhere, these are called base cases.

There are actually two base cases in the fibonacci sequence, the first and second case where they both return 1.

Write a recursive function that returns the nth fibonacci sequence. Given an integer input it returns the fibonacci number at that point in the sequence.
